# facebook-notifications-shortcut

No more adding '.' to a post just to get notifications. Get a quick button next to your like button for easy access.
Did you know that you can sign for post notifications on facebook?
A lot of people do not know about this hidden option (hidden under a menu anyway), and are adding a comment to the post just to enable these notifications.
Even more people are getting tired of getting these notifications about people who added their comment just to follow :)

This extension will add a button next to the Like button, to make it more accessible and available for you to just click.
So whether you know about this feature, or would like others to stop adding "following" comments, install this light extension and help the world be a better place.

The chrome extension is available in the webstore: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fb-get-notifications-shor/fkglmpomgfeocjhcacedncmigjhodpib
